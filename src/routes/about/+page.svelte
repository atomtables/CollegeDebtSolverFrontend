						<h2>About</h2>
						<p>Welcome to AI Stock Predictor!</p>
						<p>AI Stock Predictor is an innovative project designed to leverage the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict stock prices. Using a variety of advanced technologies, we aim to provide accurate and reliable forecasts that can help investors make informed decisions.</p>
						<h3>Our Mission</h3>
						<p>Our mission is to democratize access to sophisticated financial analysis tools, making them available to everyone from seasoned investors to those just starting their investment journey. We believe that AI and machine learning can revolutionize the way we understand and interact with the stock market.</p>
						<h3>Key Features</h3>
						<ul>
								<li>Comprehensive Data Analysis: Our platform uses data from reliable sources such as Polygon.io to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information.</li>
								<li>Advanced Machine Learning Models: We employ cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including LSTM networks, to analyze stock price trends and make predictions.</li>
								<li>User-Friendly Interface: Designed with the user in mind, our platform is easy to navigate, providing clear insights and actionable information.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
						<ul>
								<li>Python: The backbone of our project, used for data processing, model training, and analysis.</li>
								<li>Pandas and NumPy: Essential libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.</li>
								<li>TensorFlow: A powerful framework for building and training our machine learning models.</li>
								<li>Polygon.io API: Our source for comprehensive financial data.</li>
								<li>Matplotlib: Used for data visualization to help users understand stock trends and predictions.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>How It Works</h3>
						<p>1. Data Collection: We collect historical stock price data from Polygon.io, focusing on key financial metrics.</p>
						<p>2. Data Processing: The data is cleaned and preprocessed using Python libraries to ensure it's in the right format for analysis.</p>
						<p>3. Model Training: Using TensorFlow, we train an LSTM model to recognize patterns and predict future stock prices based on historical data.</p>
						<p>4. Prediction and Visualization: The model generates predictions, which are then visualized using Matplotlib to provide clear and concise insights.</p>
						<h3>Our Team</h3>
						<p>AI Stock Predictor is developed by a passionate team of data scientists, financial analysts, and software engineers dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI in finance.</p>
